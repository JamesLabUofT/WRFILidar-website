## Data Collection

Much of the data used for this project is collected through our various lidar sensors.

### Aerial lidar

Laura Chasmer and Chris Hopkinson at the University of Lethbridge have an in-house Teledyne Optech Titan sensor <pic of plane>

### RPAS lidar

Uleth, UofA, Moncton?

### Mobile lidar

USherbrooke, UofT?

### Terrestrial lidar

Uleth, Usherbrooke? Patrick James' team at the University of Toronto uses a Leica BLK360 Gen1 TLS lidar scanner.

## Data Processing

The high density lidar data our teams work with require heavy computational equipment. The data takes a lot of space, requiring large storage solutions, as well as machines with a lot of memory. Some of the computation we do is on our own hardware, such as the James Lab computation server. We also have access to the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's supercomputers.
