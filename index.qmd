::: problem-statement
**Wildfire activity is increasing in Canada** due to climate change, posing a significant threat to ecosystems, communities and infrastructure.

\

Proactive wildfire risk assessment and mitigation strategies are necessary to better understand and respond to these changes.

::: problem-statement
Central to fire mitigation strategies are the **characterization of forest fuels** (combustible vegetation, litter, and wood debris) and methods to **link those fuels to expected fire behaviour** (e.g. fire intensity, rate of spread).

\

Funded through **Natural Resources Canada's Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative** (WRFI), our research project aims to address the need to quantify fuel structures to improve understanding of fire behaviour in Canada's changing forest environments.
